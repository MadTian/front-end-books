      There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties
      of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of apples, oranges,
      and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands of choices.

      One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in
      each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for
      its apples.

      When traveling in Asia, I was struck by how many different
      kinds of banana were available - many of which had unique flavors and
      which were only available within a small region.

      And, of course, there are fruits which are truly unique - I am put in mind
      of the durian, which is widely consumed in SE Asia and is known as the
      "king of fruits." The durian is largely unknown in Europe and the USA - if
      it is known at all, it is for the overwhelming smell, which is compared
      to a combination of almonds, rotten onions and gym socks.
